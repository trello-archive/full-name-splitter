# Full Name Splitter

Human names are complicated. They don't necessarily follow any rules. Here's [a good article about the complexities of names](https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-personal-names).

As that article advises, it's ideal to just store a user's full name, and not assume anything about the form the name takes.

However, there are times when it is necessary to have a split given name and family name. Such as when integrating with another system that made different design choices.

This package does a best-guess attempt to split a full name string into given name and family name. For many Western names, it will get it right. It knows about some common family name prefixes used in many European-language names, and initials.

It'll do a better job than naÃ¯vely splitting off the first or last word.

Just don't expect it to be accurate for all names!

## Examples

```js
import { splitter } from 'full-name-splitter';

splitter("George H. W. Bush")
// => ["George H. W.", "Bush"]

splitter("Kevin J. O'Connor")
// => ["Kevin J.", "O'Connor"]

splitter("Thomas G. Della Fave")
// => ["Thomas G.", "Della Fave"]

splitter("Gabriel Van Helsing")
// => ["Gabriel", "Van Helsing"]

// If full name isn't complete, it tries to split partially:

splitter("George W.")
// => ["George W.", null]

splitter("George")
// => ["George", null]

splitter("Van Helsing")
// => [null, "Van Helsing"]

splitter("d'Artagnan")
// => [null, "d'Artagnan"]
```

For other examples see `test/src/full-name-splitter.js`

If it can't split a name correctly, it is possible to split by comma:

```js
splitter("John Quincy Adams")
// => ["John Quincy", "Adams"]

splitter("John, Quincy Adams")
// => ["John", "Quincy Adams"]
```
